      This is a 
      pool based upon the NFL season. Every week starting September 11, 2011 the 
      NFL plays up to 16 games. The object of the pool is to correctly predict 
      the winners of the games. <BR>

      Pretty much anybody as long as you get permission through the pool administrator. <BR>

      <P><A name=Howmuch></A><FONT color=#ff1919>How much does it 
      cost?</FONT><BR>The cost of the pool is $1 per week for the weekly pool 
      and $1 per week for the season pool. The season pool does have a $5 entry 
      fee that is to be paid by the third week of the season; however, the fee 
      covers the fee for weeks 13-17 of the pool. The weekly pool fee is to be 
      paid any week that the player participates. The season pool fee is paid 
      weekly to ensure the player's score gets added to his/her cumulative 
      score. This includes any weeks that a season participant is unable to 
      actually submit an entry. Both fees may be paid in full at the beginning 
      of the season, and it is suggested that the player do so if he/she plans 
      on participating every week for the full season.<BR>Fee payments should be 
      made in a timely manner to the pool treasurer. If fee payments are not 
      up-to-date, the participant will receive zero scores until the necessary 
      payments are made. The pool treasurer has the final verdict in these 
      manners and will inform the pool administrator of problems if necessary. 
      If a participant has a need to delay a payment, the pool treasurer is to 
      be informed so no penalty will be assessed. <BR><BR><A

      Bookmark biskit.myzenhost.com in 
      your browser. Every week, prior to kickoff, fill out an online form 
      completely and hit submit. There are edits built in to help you get the 
      form filled correctly. Then, if you haven't paid your money in advance, 
      you need to give your fee to the pool treasurer. You can submit separate 
      forms for weekly and season, or submit one form for both. You indicate on 
      the form what pool you are playing. When you submit an online form, an 
      automatic copy of the form contents is received by the pool administrator, 
      the pool treasurer, and yourself to ensure there are no discrepancies. 
      Please ensure the email address submitted on the form is correct and 
      active.<BR>
      The time listed on the email header will be the judge and jury 
      determining if an entry has been submitted on time. If the administrator 
      feels the entry was submitted too far after the kickoff, the player will 
      automatically lose the games that are in progress when the entry was 
      submitted.<BR>If you are unable to get online to submit a form, paper 
      forms and voice mail messages are considered valid entries. You may 
      contact the pool administrator or treasurer with your entry.<BR>Multiple 
      entries for the same person are valid for both the weekly pool and the 
      season pool. The only thing that is requested is that the season entries 
      are named uniquely, ie. Joe 1, Joe 2. This allows the scores to be added 
      to the correct totals each week. <BR><BR><A

      <P><A name=Scoring></A><FONT color=#ff1919>How are scores 
      calculated?</FONT><BR>The scoring is based on a weighted point system. The 
      first thing considered is whether the winner of each individual game is 
      picked correctly. Then, each game during the week is given a point value 
      starting with a maximum of 16. The player makes the decision as to which 
      games he/she is most confident about and gives those the highest values. 
      The games the player is most unsure about should be given the lowest point 
      values. Each point total is to be used only once per sheet. When all the 
      games for a given week have been completed, each participants point totals 
      are computed. The participants score for the week is the sum of the 
      weighted values for all the games he/she picked correctly. If there are 
      less than 16 games played in a given week, the participants should discard 
      the lowest point values when assigning points to games. The discarded 
      point totals will be adding to the participants' scores automatically each 
      week.<BR>The season pool has the same basic rules, however, there is an 
      additional rule to cover absentee entries. If a participant is unable to 
      submit an entry during a week during the season pool, that person will 
      receive a score equal to one point lower than the lowest submitted season 
      entry score for that week. <BR><BR><A

      <P><A name=Win></A><FONT color=#ff1919>When is a winner 
      determined?</FONT><BR>For the weekly version of the pool, the winner is 
      the person with the highest point total.<BR>The season pool winner is 
      determined by the accumulated score of all the weekly entries into the 
      season pool. The final winner is determined the day after the last game of 
      the regular season in the NFL. <BR><BR><A

      <P><A name=Cash></A><FONT color=#ff1919>How much can I win?</FONT><BR>The 
      weekly winner of the pool receives the cash equivalent of all the weekly 
      entry fees received. There are no runner-up prizes awarded in the weekly 
      pool.<BR>Depending upon number of entries received for the season pool, 
      either the top three or top four accumulated scores will receive a portion 
      of the total season fees received. The general breakdown of the prizes is 
      approximately 70%, 20%, 10% for three payouts or 70%, 18%, 9%, 3% for four 
      payouts. Payments for the season pool will be distributed in the days 
      immediately following the last weekend of the NFL regular season.

      <P><A name=Ties></A><FONT color=#ff1919>What if there is a 
      tie?</FONT><BR>Ties are a possibility and are accounted for. There is a 
      tiebreaker question on every entry that relates to a game or games that is 
      being played in the NFL that week. In the event of a point tie, the 
      tiebreaker question will determine the winner. If a tie remains after the 
      tiebreaker question is evaluated, then the winner will be the person that 
      picked the most games correctly. If a tie still exists, a coin flip will 
      ultimately determine the winner.<BR>The tiebreakers for the season pool are 
      multiple tiered. If there is a points tie, then the participant with the 
      most number of weeks with a greater score gets the tiebreaker. If a tie 
      exists after that, the participant who picked the most game correctly over 
      the course of the season gets the tiebreaker. If a tie still exists, then 
      the participant with the highest inidividual week score will win the 
      tiebreaker. In the event that the first three tiebreakers yield no winner, 
      then a coin flip will be used as a last resort.<BR>
      In the event there is a problem with the coin flip, a single-elimination
      javelin catching contest will determine the winner. <BR><BR><A

      <P><A name=Standings></A><FONT color=#ff1919>How will I know how I am 
      doing in the pool?</FONT><BR>Every week, return to the home page of the 
      pool and click on the link to the standings page. There will be a list of 
      every participant's score for the week, the standings for the season pool, 
      and the list of the winners of the actual NFL games for the week. If 
      events occur where the pool administrator is unable to update the 
      standings for the week, alternate arrangements will be made to inform the 
      participants of the scores. <BR><BR><A
